* [Configuration](#configuration)
* [Basic Usage](#basic-usage)
* [Advanced Search](#advanced-search)
* [Migrations](#migrations)
* [Pitfalls](#pitfalls)

## Compatibility

The current version of Elastic Scout Driver has been tested with the following configuration:

* PHP 7.2-8.0
* Elasticsearch 7.0-7.10
* Laravel 6.x-8.x
* Laravel Scout 7.x-8.x

## Installation

The library can be installed via Composer:

```bash
composer require babenkoivan/elastic-scout-driver
```

**Note**, that this library is just a driver for Laravel Scout, don't forget to install it beforehand:
```bash
composer require laravel/scout
``` 

When Scout is installed publish its configuration and change the `driver` option in the `config/scout.php` file to `elastic`:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravel\Scout\ScoutServiceProvider"
```

If you want to use Elastic Scout Driver with [Lumen framework](https://lumen.laravel.com/) check [this guide](https://github.com/babenkoivan/elastic-scout-driver/wiki/Lumen-Installation).

## Configuration

Elastic Scout Driver uses [babenkoivan/elastic-client](https://github.com/babenkoivan/elastic-client) as a dependency. 
If you want to change the default client settings (and I'm pretty sure you do), then you need to create the configuration file first:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="ElasticClient\ServiceProvider"
```

You can change Elasticsearch host and the other client settings in the `config/elastic.client.php` file. 
Please refer to [babenkoivan/elastic-client](https://github.com/babenkoivan/elastic-client) for more details.

Elastic Scout Driver itself has only one configuration option at the moment - `refresh_documents`. 
If it's set to `true` (`false` by default) documents are indexed immediately, which might be handy for testing.   

You can configure `refresh_documents` in the `config/elastic.scout_driver.php` file after publishing it with the following command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="ElasticScoutDriver\ServiceProvider"
``` 

At last, do not forget, that with Scout you can configure the searchable data, the model id and the index name.
Check [the official Scout documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/master/scout#configuration) for more details.

> Note, that the `_id` field can't be part of the searchable data, so make sure the field is excluded or renamed 
> in the `toSearchableArray` method in case you are using MongoDB as the database.

## Basic usage

Elastic driver uses Elasticsearch [query string](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html)
wrapped in a [bool query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-bool-query.html) 
under the hood. It means that you can use [mini-language syntax](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax)
when searching a model:

```php
$orders = App\Order::search('title:(Star OR Trek)')->get();
```

When the query string is omitted, the [match all query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-match-all-query.html) 
is used:
```php
$orders = App\Order::search()->where('user_id', 1)->get();
``` 

Please refer to [the official Laravel Scout documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/scout)
for more details and usage examples.

## Advanced Search

In case the basic search doesn't cover your project needs check [Elastic Scout Driver Plus](https://github.com/babenkoivan/elastic-scout-driver-plus),
which extends standard Scout search capabilities by introducing advanced query builders. These builders give you 
possibility to use compound queries, custom filters and sorting, highlights and more.

## Migrations

If you are looking for a way to control Elasticsearch index schema programmatically check [Elastic Migrations](https://github.com/babenkoivan/elastic-migrations).
Elastic Migrations allow you to modify application's index schema and share it across multiple environments with the same ease, 
that gives you Laravel database migrations.

## Pitfalls

There are few things, which are slightly different from other Scout drivers:
* As you probably know, Scout only indexes fields, which are returned by the `toSearchableArray` method. 
Elastic driver indexes a model even when `toSearchableArray` returns an empty array. You can change this behaviour by 
overwriting the `shouldBeSearchable` method of your model:
```php
public function shouldBeSearchable()
{
    return count($this->toSearchableArray()) > 0;
}
```
* Raw search returns an instance of `SearchResponse` class (see [Elastic Adapter](https://github.com/babenkoivan/elastic-adapter#search)):
```php
$searchResponse = App\Order::search('Star Trek')->raw();
``` 
* To be compatible with other drivers and to not expose internal implementation of the engine, Elastic driver ignores callback
parameter of the `search` method:
```php
App\Order::search('Star Trek', function () {
    // this will not be triggered
})->get()
```
